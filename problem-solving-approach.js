// =========================================================================
// Write a function which takes two numbers and returns their sum
// =========================================================================
// 1.Can I restate the problem in my own words?
"implement addition"
// 2. What are the inputs that go into the problem?
        // -ints?
        // -floats?
        // what about string for large numbers?
// 3.what are the outputs that should come from the solution of the problem?
    // -ints? or floats? or string?
// 4. can the outputs  be determined from the inputs? In other words, do I have enough information to solve the problem?
        // what happens if someone only passes one number to do addition then what should we return?
// 5.How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?
